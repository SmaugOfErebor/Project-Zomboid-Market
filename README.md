Yes. This project would be much more feasible if it was just a normal mod for Project Zomboid.

No. That isn't the purpose of this project.

The purpose of this project is to create an in-game market (buying and selling items between you and the server) without explicitly creating a mod, but most importantly, **without any client side files whatsoever**.

This project must always be able to function with purely vanilla clients.
